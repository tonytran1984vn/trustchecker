**Validation endpoints**: pricing change validation, treasury withdrawal validation, slashing validation, crisis action validation  
**Nguyên tắc cốt lõi**: Quyền lực khẩn cấp là TẠM THỜI, CÓ GIỚI HẠN, và CÓ THỂ KIỂM TOÁN

### Constitutional RBAC Enforcement (code-enforced, non-bypassable)

| Mount | Mô tả |
|---|---|
| `/api/charter/governance-audit` | Governance audit — 5 critical checks enforced by code |
| `/api/charter/powers/:role` | Role power map — what a role CAN, CANNOT, and CONDITIONALLY do |

| `/api/charter/separations` | 6 critical separations + cross-mapping matrix |
| `/api/charter/domain/:domain` | Domain-specific power definitions (monetization/network/crisis) |

**Middleware**: `requireConstitutionalWithAudit(action)` — CANNOT be bypassed, not even by `super_admin`. Logs EVERY allow/deny to `audit_log` DB.

**Dual-Key Enforcement**: `requireDualKey(action, roles)` — requires `x-second-approver` + `x-second-approver-role` headers. Anti-self-approval enforced.

**Deep Enforcement Coverage (9 mutation endpoints)**:

| Route | Endpoint | Constitutional Action | Extra |
|---|---|---|---|
| `infra-maturity.js` | `POST /reserves/contribute` | `monetization.treasury.payout` | — |
| | `POST /reserves/claim` | `monetization.reserve.withdraw` | — |

| `fee-distribution.js` | `POST /payout` | `monetization.treasury.payout` | **DUAL-KEY** (risk + compliance) |

**Immutable Audit Logging**: Mọi constitutional action (cả ALLOW lẫn DENY) → `[CONSTITUTIONAL-AUDIT]` console + INSERT vào `audit_log` table

**6 Critical Separations (hardcoded in code)**:

| # | Rule | Entity | Cannot |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEP-1 | Super Admin ≠ Financial Controller | `super_admin` | Revenue change, reserve withdraw, treasury payout |
| SEP-2 | Blockchain Op ≠ Governance Authority | `blockchain_operator` | Validator admit/suspend/slash, protocol upgrade |
| SEP-3 | IVU ≠ Weight Setter | `ivu_validator` | Scoring weights, validator suspend, consensus override |
| SEP-4 | Risk ≠ Execution | `risk_committee` | Reserve withdraw, treasury payout, chain anchor |
| SEP-5 | Compliance ≠ Economic Allocator | `compliance_officer` | Revenue change, pricing change, incentive change |
| SEP-6 | Treasury ≠ Policy Maker | `treasury_role` | Revenue change, pricing change, validator admit |

**Cross-Mapping Matrix**:

| Layer | Policy | Execution | Oversight | Visibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monetization | GGC | Treasury (dual-key) | Risk + Compliance | Super Admin |
| Network | GGC | Validator set | Risk | Super Admin |
| Slashing | Risk propose | GGC approve | IVU observe | Super Admin |
| SLA | GGC | Auto engine | Compliance | Super Admin |
| Crisis | Council | Technical | Compliance | Super Admin |

| `/api/charter/safeguards/audit-entry` | Create hash-chained audit entry (SHA-256, tamper-proof) |
| `/api/charter/safeguards/verify-chain` | Verify audit chain integrity: any tamper → BLACK-level alert |
| `/api/charter/safeguards/db-policy` | 4-tier DB access control policy |

**Engine**: `governance-safeguards-engine.js`

**3 Vulnerabilities Addressed**:

| # | Lỗ hổng | Giải pháp |
|---|---|---|
| VULN-1 | GGC Collusion | 40% independent minimum, 30% single-entity cap, term limits (3 terms max, 12-month cooling), mandatory recusal, validator + tenant representatives |
| VULN-2 | Risk + Compliance Collusion | Entity-separation check (same org → BLOCK), reporting-line independence, co-approval rotation after 5 uses, $10K+ requires third-party observer |
| VULN-3 | Super Admin DB Access | 4-tier PostgreSQL roles: App (write all except audit), Read-only (Super Admin), Audit (append-only), DBA (separate from Super Admin, 2FA + VPN) |

**Hash-Chained Audit**: `hash(n) = SHA256(hash(n-1) + action + actor + timestamp + details)` — chain break = tamper detected = BLACK-level crisis

> **Purpose**: Binds 70 engines into 1 coherent enforceable system.  
> Without this: 70 engines = 70 independent modules. With this: enforceable infrastructure.

### Capital → Operational Trigger Map

| Metric | Threshold | Auto-Action | Kill-Switch |
|---|---|---|---|
| CAR | < 12% | Advisory + log | — |
| CAR | < 10% | Waterfall freeze P8-P9, block high-risk onboarding | — |
| CAR | < 8% | Capital call (7d), volume cap 50%, regulatory queued | — |
| CAR | **< 6%** | **KS-05 AUTO Settlement Freeze**, emergency inject (3d) | **KS-05** |
| LCR | < 100% | Waterfall STRESS MODE (P7-P9), credit drawdown | — |
| LCR | **< 80%** | **KS-05 AUTO**, all non-essential payouts halted | **KS-05** |
| Reserve | > 30% drawdown | L3 Crisis Council, replenishment call | — |
| Reserve | **> 50% drawdown** | **KS-05 AUTO**, insurance claim filed | **KS-05** |

| -30% | **15% (constitutional floor)** | Restrict P8-P9 | GGC emergency 48h |
| -50% | 15% (floor) | **FULL STRESS (P6-P9 frozen)** | Crisis Council + Board |
| Recovery >90% | Restore 20% | Normal | Auto if was ≤30%; GGC vote if was >30% |

**Constitutional floors**: Validator ≥15%, Reserve ≥8%. Cannot be changed without charter amendment.

### Charter Amendment Governance

| Process | Duration | Threshold | Special |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | 65 days (5+30+15+15) | 75% GGC supermajority | Regulatory observer hearing (mandatory, non-binding) |
| Emergency | 48 hours | **90% GGC** | Must be L3+ crisis. Expires 90 days unless ratified. Cannot touch floors/separation/audit |
| IVU Veto | Scoring amendments | 60% validator block | GGC override: 90% |
| Validator Veto | Staking/rewards/slashing | 50% validator block | GGC override: 80% |

**Coherence Map**: 18 total linkages — 13 auto-enforce + 2 auto-adjust + 3 governance.
